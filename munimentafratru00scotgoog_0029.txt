INTRODUOTION.

Ir is much to be regretted that so little is recorded
relating to the history of the Order 01 Preaching Friars in
Sootland. The original documento cannot bc recovered, and
without them we have little except tradition to inform ue.
According to the received account, the Preaching Friars
were brought into Scotland during the reign of Alexander
II. The continuator of Fordun, and the author of a chronicle ·
printed in the Ectructoc Variis Orooicc'c bbocc'c,1 give the year

1230 as the exact date of their first appearance. It is said

that Clamant, afterwards Bishop of Dunblane, received the
habit attha hands oi S. Dominio himself, and was the first 01
the Order in this country. He is probably the same individual
who is mentioned in the Acts of the General Oouncil held at
London in1230.² He was elected and consecrated Bishop of
Dunblane in1233,³ and died in 11156.4 Spotiswood, on the
other hand, says the Order was introduced into this country
by William Malvoisin, Bishop of S. Andrews.
