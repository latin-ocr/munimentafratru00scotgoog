m . INTRODUUPION.

Many of the documents have the seals attached bo them, in

good preservation. Perhaps the most interesting is an hitherto
¹ unpublished privy seal ef J ohn, Earl of Oaniek, the Sbeward
of Scobland.¹ Though unfortunabely imperfect, enough remains
to give an idea ef the design and workmanship. The scal of
Malcolm Fleming‚ Earl of Wiglon,² is a very fine example
of fourieenih century work, in excellent preservation. Only
one scal of the conveni remeius, chat cf Roberi of Linlithgow,
in 1406,³ bui ic is a beautiful specimen, in 'the finesl suase.
’ The scal ef, ihc burgh ef Ayr occurs in 1340 ;⁴ and the seals of
the merchanis and burgesses are of special interest, being of
· very rareoccurrence.
