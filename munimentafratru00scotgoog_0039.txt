INTRODUOTION. xxix

In 1614 the magistrates oi Ayr resigned into the kings
hands the church lands and rents belonging to them, for the
purpose of getting a new infeftment in their favour.1 The
document contains apparently a complete liet of the possessione
of the Friars Preachers which were then in the hands of the
municipality. Their later history will be afterwards traced in
the documents belonging to the burgh.

The records now printed enable usto give a few of the
Priors of the Oonvent of S. Katherine, though the list is,
especially in the earlier period, obviously imperfect. The first
of whom we have any mention is John de Torry, who appears
in an undated charter‚ apparently about the first half of the
fourteenth century.² In 1401 Patrick oi (larrick ³ appears as
prior, but when he was appointed or how long he continued is
uncertain; but itis probable his successor would be Robert of

, Linlithgow, whose name and seal occur in charters of 1406.4 .

An interval of more than half a century occurs during which
no name is recorded. But in 1480 Patrick Pulty⁶ is mentioned
as prior. His name occurs in 1469,6 in 14717111111111476.8
