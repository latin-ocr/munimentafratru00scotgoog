with all acts, rights, evidente, and muniments bearing upon the cause
debated between the prior and convent oi the Friars Preachers of Ayr on
the one part, and the said bmgesses on the other, to oppose and answer in
the said cause, and to see it brought to a definitive sentence, if it should
appear manifest, with intimation that if the oue party were absent, the other
being present, we should proceed in the said cause, in so far as by law it
might be proceeded with ; and they have not compeared, but contumaciously
absented themselves, we, willing to proceed maturely in the said cause, to
overcome all their malice, do, by authority of these presents, commit,
commend, and give in charge, that ye cite the bailies of the said burgh of

cause wherefore sentence should not be delivered in the said cause, in·
timoting that whether they come on the said day or not, we shall proceed
in the said cause as law will, notwithstanding their contumacy. In sign of
this our mandate having been by you firliy executed, ye shall affir your
